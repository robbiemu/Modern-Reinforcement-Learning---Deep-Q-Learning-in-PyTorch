Dealing with Continuous State Spaces with Deep Neural Networks
---

continuous state spaces are not possible with discrete tables.

perceptrons for example, sum weights per bias, activate in sigmoid (or etc).

neurons delinearize the problem as a matrix, making tuning the network faster and easier with feed forward functions. activate in relu (or etc)

inputs are fed into the model to generate output and tune cost

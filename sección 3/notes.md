Dealing with Continuous State Spaces with Deep Neural Networks
---

continuous state spaces are not possible with discrete tables.

perceptrons for example, sum weights per bias, activate in sigmoid (or etc).

neurons delinearize the problem as a matrix, making tuning the network faster and easier with feed forward functions. activate in relu (or etc)

inputs are fed into the model to generate output and tune cost

As we progress further, we will need to input visual data
